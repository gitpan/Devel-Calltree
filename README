Devel-Calltree version 0.00_1
=============================

This module can be used during development to get some code-coverage metrics.
Unlike modules such as Devel::Cover, this module does not run any code. It only
looks at the OP-tree of your script or module.

As you may guess from the version number, this is still beta (alpha actually, 
as some features aren't yet implemented).

INSTALLATION
